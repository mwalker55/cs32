#Multiset

##About
This project served as an extension of homework 1 to teach us linked lists.  In it, we had to create a Multiset (a chain of nodes representing both a value and the number of times that value occurs in the Multiset) using a doubly linked list.  We also had to build certain functions, described in comments, around this Multiset idea.

##Running
To run this, simply create a project using the "Multiset.cpp" and "Multiset.h" files and add in your own "main.cpp" that contains tests of the Multiset.  You can write tests based on the comments given.  Sample tests are given in testMultiset.cpp.
