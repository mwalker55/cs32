#Multiset

##About
This is a collection of functions that served as the intro to a later project on linked lists.  The original multiset uses a statically allocated array while the new Multiset serves as an introduction to dynamically allocated arrays.

##Running
To run this, simply create a project using any of the following combinations:
	-"Multiset.h", "Multiset.cpp", "testMultiset.cpp"
	-"StudentMultiset.h", "StudentMultiset.cpp", "Multiset.h", "Multiset.cpp", "testStudentMultiset.cpp"
	-"newMultiset.h", "newMultiset.cpp", "testNewMultiset.cpp"

Then build and run the tests.  New tests can be created based on function descriptions given in code comments.
