#Project 3
This was the third project for Winter 2015 CS32 at UCLA: the Boulderblast video game.

##About
The engine for this game (ie. the graphics and certain other elements) was created by Prof. Carey Nachenberg.

Only student edited files are: Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, StudentWorld.cpp

In these files, I created the game logic, following good object oriented design principles while doing so.

##Running
Open the Visual Studio solution file given and simply build and run.

Note: This project will only build on Windows machines due to differences in the engine between Windows, Mac, and Linux.
